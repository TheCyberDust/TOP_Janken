This is a Javascript Assignment from The Odin Project.  The goal is to have a Developer Console "Game" of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

I started this repo around 15:00 on August 20, 2022.  The assignment only asks that the game be console based, but I want to practice
information learned in previous lessons, and potentially make it interactive after learning a bit more about Javascript.

This is the first major project assignment for javascript, so I'd also like to have a record of my coding journey, to look back on to
see how much I've improved over time.
